 ***Assignment_1***
 
 Consider a data set (Train.csv and Test.csv) related to sales of items in shops. The fields in Train.csv data set are:

  Item_Identifier: Code given to items

  Item_Weight: Weight of an item

  Item_Fat_Content: Fat content of the item like low, high etc

  Item_Visibility: A continuous value indicating the visibility of the item for a customer

  Item_Type: Type of the item like dairy, vegetables etc

  Item_MRP: Maximum retail price of the item

  Outlet_Identifier: Code given to outlets

  Outlet_Establishment_Year : Year of establishment of an outlet

  Outlet_Size: Size of an outlet like medium, high etc.

  Outlet_Location_Type: Location of the outlet in a city like Tier1, 2 etc.

  Outlet_Type: Type of the outlet like supermarket, grocery shop etc.

  Item_Outlet_Sales: Sale value of an item in outlet. It is a target variable.

  The Test.csv do not contain the field Item_Outlet_Sales.

Tasks:
  Use the Train.csv file for fitting the models (Divide this file into training set and testing set)
  Treat the missing values appropriately
  Convert the categorical data into numerical data appropriately, if necessary.
  Normalize the data, if required.
  Fit linear regression model and compute RMSE and R-Square.
  Apply regularization techniques on the data to check whether they are better than the basic linear model. Loop through various regularization parameters to display and compare R-Square.
  Fit the residual plots in all cases.
  Give your analysis on which of the independent variables have significant impact on the Sales of an outlet. Call it as a best model.
  Using this best model, predict the values of sales for the data given in the file Test.csv and compute RMSE and R-Square.

NOTE:
  Give brief explanation about each task that you are going to do.
  Draw Graphs where and when required and give interpretation of such graphs.
  Graphs must have proper labels and legends. 
  At the end of task, give your analysis on the entire dataset, about features, their importance etc.

***Day_8 (Task)***

  Bob has started his own mobile company. He wants to give tough fight to big companies like Apple,Samsung etc.
  He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies.
  Bob wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So he needs your help to solve this problem.
  In this problem you do not have to predict actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.
